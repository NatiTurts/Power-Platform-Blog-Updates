# Power Platform Blog Updates
A Power Platform solution that will consolidate all Power Platform blogs weekly and send you a summarized email every Monday


## Summary
Having multiple RSS flows per Power Platform product can get messy. More over, it's not always user-friendly to access these updates through the Power Automate notifications. This weekly flow will retrieve all Power Platform product blog updates and summarize them into product categories through a neat HTML template. Then, once a week, users can receive a summary of all blog updates via email with links to each individual blog post.
